            You are not allowed to use Lobster from the countries listed in paragraph 4.3, if you are a resident of one of these countries and/or if you use a bank account in one of these countries.  This restriction is related to the current limitations of our payment processing partner (PayPal), which will not allow its users to receive payments originating in these countries or to or from bank accounts in these countries.  While we are looking to expand the scope of payment providers, it is the current restriction by our provider. We use software which will block access to the Website if you are located in any of these countries. If you breach any restriction in this clause 4.4 you do so at your sole discretion and responsibility, and you may not hold Lobster responsible for any loss or adverse consequences resulting from such use.
          </li>
          <li>
            In particular, if you attempt to sell Content licenses using the Lobster Website to other Users and such Content licenses are purchased, if as a consequence of being located or resident in one of the countries listed above, you are not able to receive the payment for such Content licenses, notwithstanding that you have not received payment the purchase will be considered completed and the rights to use your Content will be granted to the Buyer under the License Agreement.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will not be permitted to revoke access to your Content once purchase of a license to use your Content has been initiated regardless of whether you are able to receive payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            In such circumstances, or in any circumstances where your PayPal account is unable to receive a payment, PayPal and/or Lobster may in its sole and absolute discretion do with the payment for your Content license as it sees fit including without limitation returning the payment to the Buyer’s account or donating it to a charity.  The fee due to Lobster and PayPal fees shall not be reimbursable in any circumstances. Lobster will attempt to notify you at its sole discretion, however, it does not guarantee any communication and it is the Seller’s responsibility to provide an updated account.
          </li>
          <li>
            In addition to the geographical limitations set out in paragraph 4.3, Lobster provides only partial functionality to Users residing in Russia.  Local regulations in Russia prohibiting transactions between Russian residents in a currency other than Russian Rubles mean that we cannot provide the Buyer (license purchasing) functionality to Russian residents.  A Russian resident for the purpose of this clause is any User with a Russian IP address and/or having a Russian PayPal account.  Russian residents can still enjoy the Seller functionality, register at the Website, add Content Sources and sell Licenses to other Users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lobster is working constantly to expand its geography and payment methods and we aim to cover all countries in the near future.  If you believe that your case is an exception (e.g. you are a UK resident Seller travelling in Ukraine) and that we need to grant you a worldwide access to the Website, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@lobster.media">support@lobster.media</a> and we will review your case.  Please note that we will need to have a proof of your residence and/or your ability to receive payments through PayPal in order to review your case.

          <li>
            The Website is an online venue to allow users who comply with Lobster's policies to display, offer, sell, find and buy licenses for certain digital goods (the “Content”) within a fixed-price and dynamic price format, as well as download the digital goods and receive licenses based on subscriptions and packages and via an API.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lobster is not directly involved in the transaction between Buyers and Sellers and is not a party to any contract between them.  As a result, Lobster has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the Content listed, the truth or accuracy of any listing, the ability or title of any Seller to sell any item or the ability of any Buyer to pay for any item.  Lobster does not pre-screen Users or the Content or information provided by Users.  Lobster cannot ensure that a Buyer or Seller will actually complete a transaction. Even though we attempt to help eliminate questionable or copyright infringing content and users, this does not constitute a default part of our services and we can not be held accountable for any discrepancies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lobster cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a User.  Lobster encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners in case of questions, except for specific projects and cases, where such identification is agreed with the Buyer and constitutes part of the special service provided at an additional cost.
          </li>
          <li>
            You acknowledge and agree that Lobster is a venue and as such is not responsible or liable for any Content, including without limitation data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other Users, or outside parties on the Website.

          <li>
            You agree to allow Lobster to store or re-format your Content on the Website and to display your Content on the Website in any way that Lobster sees necessary to perform the services and in accordance with these terms and/or the terms of use of API of our partners.

          </li>
          <li>
            Lobster does not control the Content provided by Users. Lobster is not liable for any loss, harm or upset directly or indirectly caused by any Content.

            There may be risks dealing with international trade and foreign nationals.  By using the Services, you agree to accept such risks and that Lobster (and Lobster's officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) is not responsible for any and all acts or omissions of Users on Lobster.  Please use caution, common sense, and practice safe buying and selling when using the Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lobster sources User Content available for immediate licensing from social media platforms and third party apps (together the “Sources”) via API or other means of technical integration. This is agreed to and explicitly confirmed by Users when signing up on Lobster. Any such Content should follow the Sources rules and limitations (including their content policies). Users are encouraged to get familiar with the terms and policies of the respective Source before using either the Source or Lobster.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lobster operates a public search of all public accounts’ content available through respective Sources with a possibility to request the author to license the content (‘opt in to Lobster’). Lobster accesses and displays content for its ‘find and request’ functionality without user consent, as API access to public content and, in general, public viewing of any publicly posted content constitutes part of the services the Sources provide to their users. Lobster does not source private content (from private accounts) without prior user (contributor) consent. Lobster does not enable buying a license for content without prior user (contributor) consent.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a Buyer on Lobster is interested in buying a license for content item that does not belong to immediately available (opted in) content from its Sellers, Lobster will request the respective contributor for ‘opt in’ or ‘opt out’ to license the content in question, prior to enabling such transaction. Lobster will communicate the request through any available public (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and other) or private (e-mail) channel that we are able to find in the open access or within our database. Lobster may comment on the contributor’s posts for the purpose of requesting a license on behalf of a Buyer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lobster may use our contributors’ content for the purpose of marketing, communications, featuring it on the blog and in galleries. Whenever Lobster needs to use the content without a watermark and in an original size (that is, except showcasing content on our website to improve purchases), we will buy a license for the specific content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lobster does not guarantee the compliance of any User Content with the Source terms and rules. It is the User’s own responsibility to ensure that the Content follows Source terms and rules prior to posting, selling or purchasing such Content.

              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>

        <ol>
          <li>
            The Seller represents and warrants that he or she has obtained all relevant permissions to license any Content, including but not limited to execution of any Model Release and/or Property Release.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Model Release is a legal release signed by each person represented in a photograph or video granting permission to use or publish the photograph or video using such person (or persons). A sample model release form may be found attached hereto as Appendix 2 and Users of the Website should use a similar form for their projects.  This is the form referred to herein as a "Model Release". This release is intended for use by models over the age of 18.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Minor Model Release (an example of which is attached hereto as Appendix 2) should be used for models under the age of 18.  It contains language referring to the model (who is a minor) in the third-person, and requires signature by a parent or other legal guardian of the model.  A release which is not signed by a parent or guardian affords no legal protection to the publisher.  No image or video should be uploaded to the Website showing a minor model in a state of undress.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Property Release is a legal release signed by the owner of property used in a photograph or video granting permission to use or publish the photograph or video in one form or another. A sample property release form is attached hereto as Appendix 2 and Users of the Website should use a similar form for their projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are including the depiction of recognizable private property on video, photograph, or a traced illustration, you will need a signed location release from the property owner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users do not need a release for public property, such as government buildings (although you  may run into problems just from photographing/videoing them, for security reasons!). For images of private property — and particularly of objects that are closely identified with specific people —  photographers are urged to secure a release.  Most animals in zoos are the property of the zoo and usually cannot be used for commercial purposes without the consent of the zoo.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case paper forms are not available, a User may consider using an electronic release App, such as:<br />

          </li>
          <li>
            If a user has obtained a model release (or property release) in any appropriate form as per above, the user is kindly requested to mark such content with an #model_release (or #property_release) hashtag to signal to the Buyer that such content may be used for commercial purposes with the respective permissions
          </li>
          <li>
            Lobster is not responsible for checking or obtaining model releases and can not be held accountable for their availability and/or true or false tagging by the author;
          </li>
          <li>
            However, Lobster may undertake, with the use of its technology, an attempt to identify recognizable people faces in the image. In the case of identifiable faces (or logos, or landmarks in the photo) Lobster may, at its own discretion, do one of the following:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Remove such content from the search results of the marketplace automatically, permanently or until resolved with the author
              </li>
              <li>
                Flag and ask the author to provide the model release or permission to use trademarks or landmarks images in question
              </li>
              <li>
                Initiate an e-mail request for a formal Model Release to the author
              </li>
              <li>
                Initiate contact with the person(s) in the photo through their public profiles (Facebook, Instagram and such) to request them for a model release and relevant permissions
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If the content item contains the face of an author or his children (for whom he or she has the right to otherwise provide a minor release), they are considered as having permission automatically. That is, any such photos are subject to an auto-model release by the author regarding the author’s own photos or those of his minors.

            By accepting these Terms a Seller agrees to provide all necessary information about any Model Release and Property Release in respect of Content and /or copies of such documents for the Buyer’s records upon the Buyer’s request.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Seller further agrees that, unless he has obtained a Model Release and/or Property Release where he is required by the Buyer according to applicable laws and the use cases described in these Terms, the Seller is deemed to be licensing the relevant Content under an editorial license. If the Seller has obtained, stores and is able to provide the evidence of all Model Releases and Property Releases, or if these are not required according to applicable laws and the use cases described in these Terms (e.g. there are no models and private property in the Content), the Seller may license the Content to the Buyer under a commercial use license.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Seller is encouraged to tag his Content with the respective tags: <span class="orange">#editorialuse</span>  (meaning the Content can be used for Editorial use and that any required Model Release and/or Property Release has not been obtained); <span class="orange">#modelrelease</span> (meaning that all necessary Model Releases have been obtained by the Seller and may be provided to Buyers upon request); <span class="orange">#propertyrelease</span> (meaning all necessary Property Releases have been obtained by the Seller and may be provided to Buyers upon request). A Seller not use the two <span class="orange">#modelrelease</span> or <span class="orange">#propertyrelease</span> tags if he has obtained releases only partially.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is at the same time strongly advised that a Buyer, who wants to purchase a commercial use license for Content via the Website from a Seller contacts the Seller via any available public profile in order to ensure that the Seller has obtained all required Model Releases and Property Releases.  Lobster does not collect any Model Releases or Property Releases and Lobster does not provide any warranty or confirmation that a Seller has obtained any required Model Releases and Property Releases.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lobster may, upon request, help the Buyer solicit the model release verifications from the Seller or their models at an additional cost.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lobster does not otherwise, as per general service terms, bear any responsibility for the content in question having a model or property release and any damages caused to either of the parties. However, Lobster may at its own discretion undertake to differentiate, eliminate, flag or mark content in question and request authors and models for a release confirmation. Lobster also provides an opportunity to complain for unsolicited model permission through its ‘complain’ button.
          </li>
          <li>
            For any Content, which may require Model Release or Property Release under applicable law or by these Terms, and for which he is not sure a copy of Model Release and/or Property Release has been obtained and/or verified, a Buyer should consider only the use under editorial license / editorial use only. This does not concern any Content that does not contain property or people and, therefore, will not require Model or Property release for commercial use. It is the Buyer’s responsibility to make sure he/she is in accordance with the legislation when using the Content and to prevent any damages, coordinate with the Seller or make the Seller liable for any damages that may occur otherwise, holding Lobster completely with no liability for any such events, damages or loss, unless a specific verification service has been purchased.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the purposes of these Terms, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Commercial Use</strong>:  any media in relation to which money exchanges hands. Money could be paid for the subject of the photograph/footage/media or the media itself. Wholesale, retail, and professional uses of photography would fall under this definition. The commercial photographic world could include: advertising photography - photographs made to illustrate and usually sell a service or product.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <strong>Editorial Use</strong>: when an image is used in conjunction with, and to illustrate, a news related story or any non-commercial text demanding imagery. Examples include magazines, newspapers, features and books. When deciding on the editorial use of the content and considering privacy laws, a User should ask the following questions:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      does there exist "a reasonable expectation that one could be photographed by the general public without the person's knowledge"?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      is there ‘newsworthiness’ of the subject? Editorial use of a photograph is found in a newsworthy item. Courts traditionally have defined public interest or newsworthiness in liberal and far reaching terms. It is not limited to dissemination of news in the sense of current events, but extends far beyond that to include all types of factual, educational and historical data, or even entertainment and amusement, concerning interesting phases of human activity in general.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      what is the relationship between the photographer and the subject? The special relationship between the photographer and the person that hired him has been upheld in court cases, especially those involving weddings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      how much "orchestration" was necessary in order to capture the photo?  The idea is that the more involved the photographer and subject are in coordinating how photos are taken, the more "invasive" the photographer is on the privacy rights of the subject. If the subject is directed in a controlled situation, he is no longer acting on his own accord. He is doing what he is told to do. As a result photos of him may not necessarily be representative of him. Even if he is agreeing to be photographed, he still maintains some rights of privacy.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
              </li>

            Lobster currently uses PayPal to process all payments.  The Buyer is encouraged to set up a PayPal account in advance, however, if he does not have a PayPal account, an account can be created directly during the purchasing process.  Please check PayPal website for availability, currencies and terms of payments in advance <a href="https://www.paypal.com/worldwide/">https://www.paypal.com/worldwide/</a>.
          </li>

            When PayPal is used, its payment page is initiated automatically at the moment of purchase.  A Buyer needs to use his PayPal account (e-mail) and password in the PayPal popup window to complete the payment.  For repeat purchase / logged in PayPal user only a password is required.  The Seller’s account is pre-filled automatically so the Buyer is not required to fill any payment details. Lobster does not, however, guarantee that the functioning of PayPal will follow the same process in future. Please refer to the PayPal website for more information at any time.

            Lobster may add other payment methods at its discretion, including Braintree, Stripe, credit card acquirers and other. The payment fee is always distributed between Lobster and the Seller, unless otherwise stated (added) during purchase.

            The single price of one license for Content purchased via the Website starts at $0.99 for a standard photo and can grow according to license type, content quality, content demand and additional services added, at the Website's discretion.

          <li>
            The Buyer pays the price via Lobster. Lobster fees currently constitute 25% of every transaction (including any VAT).

        <ol>
          <li>
            Whenever in accordance with the Terms herein, the Content is identified by the Licensee as suitable for editorial use and for editorial use only, - in particular, whenever the Content includes models or property in the newsworthy context and for which no releases have been obtained, the Licensee should consider Content as licensed under the Editorial License.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the purpose of Editorial License the same conditions apply as for Commercial License herein with additional limitation on the permitted use. The only permitted use for Editorial License is:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Editorial Use of Content, which means use relating to events that are newsworthy or of general interest and expressly excludes any advertorial sections (i.e. sections or supplements featuring brand and/or product names or sections or supplements in relation to which you receive a fee from a third-party advertiser or sponsor);
              </li>
              <li>
                Editorial Use: when an image is used in conjunction with, and to illustrate, a news related story or any non-commercial text demanding imagery. Examples include magazines, newspapers, features and books. When deciding on the editorial use of the content and considering privacy laws, a User should ask the following questions:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    does there exist "a reasonable expectation that one could be photographed by the general public without the person's knowledge"?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    is there ‘newsworthiness’ of the subject? Editorial use of a photograph is found in a newsworthy item. Courts traditionally have defined public interest or newsworthiness in liberal and far reaching terms. It is not limited to dissemination of news in the sense of current events, but extends far beyond that to include all types of factual, educational and historical data, or even entertainment and amusement, concerning interesting phases of human activity in general. However, a User needs to be careful when deciding on the newsworthiness of the subject.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    what is the relationship between the photographer and the subject? The special relationship between the photographer and the person that hired him has been upheld in court cases, especially those involving weddings.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    how much "orchestration" was necessary in order to capture the photo?  The idea is that the more involved the photographer and subject are in coordinating how photos are taken, the more "invasive" the photographer is on the privacy rights of the subject. if the subject is directed in a controlled situation, he is no longer acting on his own accord--he's doing what he's told to do--so photos of him may not necessarily be representative of him. Even if he's agreeing to be photographed, he still maintains some rights of privacy.
                  </li>
